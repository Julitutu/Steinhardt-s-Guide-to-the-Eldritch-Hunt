		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Eldritch Hunt is sworn to the eradication of the unnatural, the aberrant, and the alien. These hunters tread a fine line, enhancing themselves with their prey’s powers whilst trying to maintain their own sanity. Unfortunately, this frenzied hunger drives many to madness, and it is no rare occurrence for these paladins to have to hunt their own. This oath is found most frequently among paladins of the Radiant Order. Erroneously nicknamed grey templars, witch hunters, and knights aberrant, these oft-deformed warriors devote themselves to obliterating the scourge and its creations.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Tenets of the Eldritch Hunt</b></p>
			<p><b><i>Resolve.</i></b> Through willpower and tenacity, the strain of the hunt is endured; aching limbs and ailing minds are no reason to fall short.</p>
			<p><b><i>Respect.</i></b> Take life only when doing so protects others. Kill only when necessary, lest the bloodshed enamour your soul and hunter becomes beast.</p>
			<p><b><i>Responsibility.</i></b> Many rely on your talent to survive the moonlit nights. No matter the circumstances, do not fail them. Sacrifice your own body so that others can retain the sanctity of their own, untainted forms.</p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hunt the Prey.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can call upon the sanctified hunt. You designate a creature within 60 feet of you as your prey, marking the target for 1 minute. As part of casting this channel divinity, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the marked target. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the marked target.</p>
