		<description>
			<p>The Circle of Symbiosis allows druids devoted to Nature to become one with it—in the most real sense of the word. These druids have mastered osteomancy and use it to sever their own limbs and replace them with fragments of the natural world. To become “awakened symbiotic entities”, something others would decry as aberrations, they graft one or multiple limbs to their body. Deer hind-legs replace their own, tree branches take over their arms, and the most devoted and zealous replace their head with that of an animal.</p>
			<p class="indent">By reveling in such powers, the Circle of Symbiosis seeks to make all living beings one with Nature, or else. No sacrifice is too great for the cause. As such, even children of the Circle are forced to undergo these often deadly abscissions, developing their rampaging powers soon after and with great affinity. As these druids age, they become indistinguishable from their grafts, their humanity slowly waning to make way for something more implacable, more unyielding. Their practices have shunned them from most civilized locales, a punishment that hasn’t stopped them from recruiting—or abducting—more to join their cause.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can unleash the vicious natural powers held amidst your flesh. As an action, you may expend a use of your Wild Shape to awaken Nature’s anger, turning into a behemoth, rather than transforming into a beast form. A deer skull, wooden skin, goat hooves, or other such natural gifts overtake your body. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your arms count as clubs, each under the effect of the shillelagh spell.</li>
				<li>You are under the effect of the barkskin spell, although you do not need to concentrate on it. In addition, whenever a creature damages you with an attack, your skin splinters and all creatures of your choice within 5 feet of you take 1d4 magical piercing damage. This damage increases to 2d4 at 10th level.</li>
				<li>The stress of battle stimulates your organism to fight and survive. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to half the damage taken since the start of your previous turn (rounded down, minimum of 0), up to a maximum of three times your Wisdom modifier. This regeneration doesn’t work if you are unconscious.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">These benefits last for 10 minutes, or until you use your Wild Shape again. You cannot use this transformation if you are wearing armor.</p>
