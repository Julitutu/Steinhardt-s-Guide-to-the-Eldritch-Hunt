		<description>
			<p>Enshrouded within the radiance of Luyarnha, a conclave of rangers lies concealed, their solemn duty vowed to the preservation of peace within the walls, regardless of the means. Ever vigilant against the insidious advance of the scourge, they have honed their inquisitorial craft, recognizing the importance of early prevention of this plague, achieved by finding and interrogating victims, and even potential victims, before signs of sickness manifest themselves.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although these rangers have been known to serve the clergy and royalty, since the fall of the House of Commons, they are no longer beholden to the fickle desires of any specific lord or lady. Many are now driven by a loftier purpose, one that necessitates the utmost discipline and commitment, for they recognize that if the Scourge is allowed to propagate, it shall wreak havoc upon all they cherish. Yet, some pursue baser ambitions, offering their expertise to those who desire to bend these rangers to their malevolent will, extracting confessions or inflicting retribution upon adversaries. After all, torture, a practice as ancient as the very bedrock of the earth, is a dreadful instrument, potent enough to shatter even the most indomitable of spirits.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the throes of battle, these rangers bring their torturous expertise with them, employing it with merciless precision to break their enemies, methodically subjecting them to unspeakable agony. They do not recoil from these savage tactics, for they understand that failure means death or a fate grimmer still. They show no mercy to their foes, for they are well aware that none would be extended to them in kind.</p>

				<p class="flavor"><b>Disclaimer:</b> Please be advised that while some may use torture as a plot device or as a means of gathering information, it is a sensitive and disturbing topic. While the use of torture can be integral to the story being told, which is why it is included in this book, it is important to ensure that everyone at the table comes to an agreement regarding its use prior to the session beginning, and if it’s included, whether descriptions should fade to black or be more detailed.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to use techniques. Unlike others who require patience and careful preparation, you employ techniques that are fueled by your magic, letting you make use of torture tools even in the midst of hunts.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use each technique twice and regain the ability to do so again when you finish a long rest, or when you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to reuse it.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Techniques.</i></b> When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature while you have torture tools in one hand (or a free hand and the presence of torture tools at your disposal, such as strapped around your leg), as part of that attack, you can use a technique to enhance it in some way. You must use the technique before the attack roll is made, and regardless of the outcome, the use or the spell slot is expended. You can only use a technique once per turn, though you can use multiple different techniques in the same turn, and you can only use one technique per attack.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Empowered Techniques.</i></b> At certain levels in this class, you gain the ability to empower your torturer techniques using magic. When you expend a spell slot to use a technique, you inflict extra damage, and the target suffers a penalty to saving throws it makes against the technique, as shown on the following table. You can’t empower a technique using a spell slot of a level you haven’t unlocked, even if you have higher level spell slots (e.g., through multiclassing or items).</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Ranger level</td><td>Spell Slot Unlocked</td><td>Extra Damage</td><td>Saving Throw Penalty</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>3rd</td><td>1st</td><td>Wisdom mod</td><td>-1d4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5th</td><td>2nd</td><td>2 x Wisdom mod</td><td>-2d4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9th</td><td>3rd</td><td>3 x Wisdom mod</td><td>-3d4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>13th</td><td>4th</td><td>4 x Wisdom mod</td><td>-4d4</td></tr>
				<tr><td>17th</td><td>5th</td><td>5 x Wisdom mod</td><td>-5d4</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, the first two times you use a technique after you finish a long rest, you can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, in which case the technique is empowered as if you had expended a spell slot one level higher (up to a maximum of the highest spell slot you’ve unlocked).</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Saving Throws.</i></b> Some of your techniques require your target to make a saving throw to resist the technique’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<center><p><b>Technique save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p></center>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Techniques</i></b></p>
			<p class="indent">At 3rd level, you learn each of the following techniques. At higher levels, these techniques are improved.</p>

			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Exhaustion.</em></strong> Using these tools for 1 hour on a restrained creature causes them to gain 1 level of exhaustion, after which you must make a Dexterity (torture tools) check. The DC is equal to 20 - the creature’s Constitution modifier. On a failure, the creature takes 10 points of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.</p>
