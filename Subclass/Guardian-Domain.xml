			<p>Clerics of the Radiant Church are venerated as saint-like figures, and those who walk the path of the guardian even more so. Such overwhelming praise was only heightened by the arrival of the scourge, and the countless heroic actions performed by the Church anchored it as a beacon of salvation in the heart of the citizens of Luyarnha. This abundant reverence has its risks, of course, though few dare point it out; a zealous crowd is best left well alone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Guardian domain clerics were the first to jump into combat against the beasts, and to this day haven't backed down from the battle, despite the pain and loss they have endured. Their protective spirit is embodied in their magic—summoning guardian angels—which swoop to their side, protecting any who would ask under their wings. Although the features of these angels can be unsettling, none would dare doubt their intentions.</p>
