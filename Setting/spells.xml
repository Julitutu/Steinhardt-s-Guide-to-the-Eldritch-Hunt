			<p>You flick your finger against a creature. The target is impacted by a devastating gravitational force and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 120 feet away from you. The push stops early if the creature hits a solid surface or is pushed into a creature of its size or larger. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.</p>
			<p>If the target is pushed into or through the space of a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage is increased by 1d10 per size smaller the creature is than the target.</p>
			<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the target takes an extra 1d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 30 additional feet for each slot level above 4th.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You call upon the power of the Great Ones, seeking their guidance and power. Until the spell ends, you gain the ability to cast any spell from the warlock spell list of 5th level or lower without expending a spell slot or needing to prepare the spell. As part of casting this spell, you can cast a spell with a casting time of an action from your newfound spell list. However, the cost of using this power is steep. At the end of each of your turns, you must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 2d10 psychic damage. If you fail this saving throw two times, the spell ends early and you gain a short-term madness.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You dramatically increase the pull of gravity in a 30-footradius, 300-foot-high cylinder centered on a point on the ground within range. Creatures in this area are knocked prone and cannot lose this condition while there. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is knocked prone and takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A flying creature in the area immediately falls to the ground and is knocked prone. A creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw to move or perform any action. Each foot of movement while in the area costs a creature 3 extra feet.</p>
			<p>A prone creature that ends its turn in the cylinder must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be forced into the ground as gravity pulls it down. It is restrained and incapacitated by the crushing pressure and the ground around it, but it gains the benefits of three-quarters cover, as only the upper part of their body is visible. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself from the ground on a success.</p>
			<p>If the spell lasts for its full duration, the ground cracks under the tremendous weight generated and becomes difficult terrain. Each 5-foot-square area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand to remove the difficult terrain.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You focus threads of magical energy around you which coalesce into the aspect of death, an avatar made of bones, which surrounds you and fights on your behalf. The avatar is Large, is centered on you, and moves with you. While it is summoned, it protects you from foes; you are considered behind three-quarters cover at all times, have resistance to all damage, are immune to being grappled, and no other creature can enter the space of the avatar.</p>
			<p>In addition, while active, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and saving throws, and when you cast a spell that deals bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage, it is cast with a spell slot 2 levels higher than the one expended (to a maximum of 9th level).</p>

		<description>
			<p>When you cast this spell, you create a crack in the world, letting the will of a Great One smother a creature of your choice within range. The direct contact with the eldritch being causes the target to take 8d6 psychic damage, and it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature is pulled in through the tear to the cosmos. On a success, it isn't pulled but gains a long-term madness, and the spell ends.</p>
			<p>While in the cosmos, the target is incapacitated. At the beginning of each of its turns while there, it takes 3d6 cold damage, 3d6 psychic damage, and must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a shortterm madness.</p>
			<p>When the spell ends, if the target is still alive, it reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the creature is killed while in the void, its corpse never returns. A body that disappears in this way can never be recovered, not even with a wish spell.</p>
			<p>If your concentration on the spell ends early, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or gain a long-term madness as the eldritch whispers revolt and assault your mind.</p>
			<p>When the spell ends, roll a d100. On a 1, the breach doesn’t close and instead only expands, threatening to absorb the entire world.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The most lethal osteomantic power. You can cause the skeleton of a creature to liquefy in a matter of seconds, causing the body to collapse in on itself. Choose a creature within your reach; it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or die.</p>
			<p>A successful save prevents the death by skeletal collapse, but the creature still takes 10d6 necrotic damage. Creatures without bones and creatures whose CR or character level is equal to or higher than the caster’s CR or character level are immune to this spell.</p>

			<p>A Club or Quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. If the attack deals damage, it can be Force damage or the weapon's normal damage type (your choice).</p>
			<p>The spell ends early if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">The weapon's damage die changes when you reach levels 5 (d10), 11 (d12), and 17 (2d6).</p>
