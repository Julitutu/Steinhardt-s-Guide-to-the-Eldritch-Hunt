        <description>
            <p>Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 2d12 slashing damage instead. If this attack deals more than one-quarter of a creature’s hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM’s discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.</p>

      <description>
        <p>As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, the hook detaches from the creature and reattaches itself to the blunderbuss.</p>

            <p>When you attack with the stick, if you roll a 1 on the d20, it is destroyed and unusable. If this occurs during the transformed state of the stick, the stick not used in the attack remains, but cannot be untransformed.

        <description>
        <p>Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature’s soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of one soul.</p>

        <description>
        <p>When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</p>

        <p>Whenever you hit an undead creature with an attack using this blade then, for the next minute, you can see its form as a glowing outline, even if it is invisible, and you always know the direction and distance to the creature while it is on the same plane as you. This effect ends early if you hit a different undead creature with an attack using this blade, or if the phantom limb is no longer in its transformed state.</p>

        <p>As a bonus action, you can increase the polarity of the focus. For the next minute, creatures you target with spells that deal lightning damage have a -3 penalty to their saving throw against that spell if they are wearing or carrying metal. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

    <description>
    <p>When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to detonate the creature. The creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The detonation pushes you 10 feet away from the creature. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>While holding this weapon, you can unleash the rage held within its bones to make a ranged weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, you deal the weapon’s damage and lightning streaks from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a ranged weapon attack against the new target, and on a hit, deal the weapon’s damage and the lightning streaks again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of guiding fury. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

    <element name="Fireblood Poison" type="Weapon Property" source="Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt" id="ID_LT_SGEH_WEAPON_PROPERTY_FIREBLOOD_POISON">
    <description>
        <p>Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.</p>

            <p>When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property. This property can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</p>

            <p>Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature two times with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy singes them. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

        <description>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can detonate all the bone shards embedded in one of your prey. If the target is dead, the shards fail to detonate. Each creature other than you within 15 feet of the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each bone shard that detonated. On a success, it takes half as much damage. The bone shards shatter into dust and disappear. A creature with more than 2 bone shards embedded in its body has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>

        <description>
            <p>If the lantern is holding at least one soul, the maul sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Each creature of your choice that enters the bright light for the first time on a turn or start its turn there must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you until the start of its next turn. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</p>

    <element name="Void Absorption" type="Weapon Property" source="Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt" id="ID_LT_SGEH_WEAPON_PROPERTY_VOID_ABSORPTION">
        <description>
            <p>The void that fills the blade is capable of absorbing magic. While holding the untransformed shard, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the shard in the form of charges. The number of charges gained is equivalent to the level of the spell when it was cast (minimum of 1 for cantrips). The shard can absorb and store up to 10 charges. If the shard doesn’t have enough empty charges for a spell, it fails to absorb it. The blade regains all charges each time the moon changes.</p>

            <p>In dire situations, the épée grants you the power to take the life of others. If you are reduced to one-quarter of your hit points or fewer, you can immediately use this property (no action required). Until the end of your next turn, whenever you deal damage using this weapon, you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can unleash judgment upon the heretics. The blade’s light is summoned for the next minute or until you fall unconscious or transform the weapon. You and all hostile creatures within the bright light immediately take 2d8 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage whenever you damage a creature with the épée, and radiant damage you deal ignores resistance to radiant damage.</p>

        <description>
            <p>(Shortsword or Longsword) &amp; Shears</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shortsword and &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shear, add both attacks to &apos;Attacks &amp; Spellcasting&apos;, then delete one of the &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos;.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The guillotine shears are a wonder of mechanical engineering, created to tend to Carmella’s garden. Once used to cut excess foliage, it has now been repurposed to sever limbs instead of greenery. This trick weapon was given to hunters as a means of containing the scourge—if they couldn’t kill the beasts, they could at least cripple them.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Trick Weapon.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon—shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can’t use the Guillotine property on this attack.</li>
                <li>When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong><em>Untransformed.</em></strong> While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Transformed.</em></strong> The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d10 slashing damage on a hit. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Guillotine.</em></strong> Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 2d12 slashing damage instead. If this attack deals more than one-quarter of a creature’s hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM’s discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.</p>

            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>Recomendation</h5>

            <p>When the manikin of the Sloered abattoir gained sentience, the Scions sent enforcers to quell this threat to Luyarnha’s delicate existence. From the abbatoir’s meat hooks and the blunderbusses of the slain enforcers, The Slaughtered—as the manikins named themselves—crafted these versatile weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nicknamed “the meat hook”, the hookshot is a trick weapon used by hunters to help close the gap to their prey in a devastating whirl of blades and gunpowder.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Hookshot.</i></b> As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, the hook detaches from the creature and reattaches itself to the blunderbuss.</p>

            <p>One of the most versatile weapons of the church.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the sanctified partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +2 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> This glaive doesn’t have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 1d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced by 15 feet. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target’s feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.</p>

                <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shortsword and &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shear, add both attacks to &apos;Attacks &amp; Spellcasting&apos;, then delete one of the &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos;.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Rather than carrying separate firearms, which often become ineffective when beasts get close, many hunters conceal them within enormous cleavers designed to rend flesh. Such creations of gunpowder and metal are aptly named rifling cleavers.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, it is is a large cleaver. In its transformed state, the weapon is a rifle. You can reload the rifle even in its untransformed state.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> After making a melee weapon attack with this weapon, you can immediately use your bonus action to make a ranged weapon attack with the rifle against a creature within range that is behind you and in a straight line with you and your first target. This shot extends the weapon, transforming it.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> Though unwieldy in melee, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the rifle. This attack uses your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier. The damage die for this attack is a d4, and it deals bludgeoning damage. Your weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</p>

            <p>Infused with otherworldly ichor, this dark blade is given to warriors of the Abyss Warden, forged from the remains of the monsters they’ve slain. The elegant and virtuous design of the weapon hides its macabre origins, mirroring the order it came from.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by sliding the pommel up and down on the blade. In its untransformed state, the abyss warden's axeblade is a longsword. In its transformed state, the weapon becomes a battleaxe. As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage. Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Special</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shortsword and &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shear, add both attacks to &apos;Attacks &amp; Spellcasting&apos;, then delete one of the &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos;.</p>
            </div>
            <p>To gain the benefits of the cordyceps sinensis, you must ingest it, or graft it underneath your skin. For 24 hours, the fungus will incubate within you; during that time, if you swallow liquid flames or light the grafted area ablaze, you will kill the parasite. After 24 hours have passed, the only way to remove the parasite is with a <i>remove curse</i> spell cast at 6th level or higher. If you receive Nawre’s Blessing, nothing short of a <i>wish</i> spell will remove the fungus.</p>
            <p class="indent">While infected with the cordyceps sinensis, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you have Nawre’s Blessing tattooed or carved onto your body, the parasite becomes a trick weapon for you. You can use your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this magic weapon. In its untransformed state, it is a squashy tendril that emerges from your chest. In its transformed state, the parasite turns both your arms into grotesque elastic appendages of flesh.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The tendril is a simple melee weapon for you that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit and has the reach property. You can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with the weapon. In addition, your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The tendrils infiltrate your arms, turning them into massive clobbering weapons. In this form, you cannot wield any weapon or shield in your hands. These tendrils count as simple melee weapons for you, deal 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and have the reach property. When you make an attack on your turn, you can choose to do so with both arms at once, treating them as a two-handed weapon that deals 2d8 damage on a hit.</p>
            <p><b><i>Curse: Evolved Parasite.</i></b> If you die while infected with the cordyceps sinensis, the parasite gains more control over your body; if you die three times, you become an NPC under the GM’s control, and your goals become aligned with that of Nawre. A GM can devise a way for the host to regain control over their body.</p>

            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single massive maul.</p>
            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to half your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest Property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Harvest.</i></b> Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature’s soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of one soul.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The maul gains the Soul Explosion property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Soul Explosion.</i></b> When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</p>

        <description>
        <p>Longsword</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shortsword and &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shear, add both attacks to &apos;Attacks &amp; Spellcasting&apos;, then delete one of the &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos;.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The electric sawblade is a viciously effective tool of war that combines the lethality of silver and electricity. The hilt and guard resemble those of a hunter's longsword, often ornately adorned with the markings of the hunter's faction, symbols of the Radiant Church, or grim skulls that embody the dominion over death of the Scions. From this hilt extends the true terror of the weapon: a broad, straight blade constructed from dozens of razor-sharp, silvered teeth arranged in a looped chain. When wielded, these teeth whirr into a blur of destructive motion, capable of rending flesh, bone, and even the thick hide of beasts with horrifying ease. A powerful generator housed within the hilt infuses the gnashing teeth with crackling energy, adding a galvanizing quality to each cut and rip.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> This longsword has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge as a bonus action to pull the trigger under the blade to transform and infuse it with electricity for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you use a bonus action to stop the current. This weapon regains 1 charge for each 10 minutes that it spends inside a miniature Galespire Coil (often found in hunter's workshops).</p>
            <p>This silvered longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls against creatures not wearing metal armor, as long as the sword has at least 1 charge.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> When a melee attack that you can see would hit you, you can use your reaction to parry the attack, adding a bonus to your AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack. If this causes the attack to miss you and it was made with a nonmagical weapon, the weapon is destroyed by the teeth of the sawblade.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The surge of electricity causes the blade to rev faster, requiring both hands to control it. If you use one hand to attack with this sword while it is transformed, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with it. While transformed, the longsword deals an extra 1d6 slashing and 1d6 lightning damage. In addition, the momentum generated from it propels you. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</p>

                <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shortsword and &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shear, add both attacks to &apos;Attacks &amp; Spellcasting&apos;, then delete one of the &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos;.</p>
            </div>
            <p>A sanctified partisan that was reinforced using gravity magic, typically given to high ranking hunters.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gravitational partisan is a spear and a shield. In its transformed state, the spear is sheathed by the shield, which retracts into a massive blade; the weapon becomes a glaive.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Using this pair of weapons together requires the spear to be held in one hand and the shield in the other. When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to deflect with the shield, gaining a +4 bonus to AC against that attack. If the attack misses, you can immediately make a single melee weapon attack with the spear as part of the same reaction. On a hit, as part of the attack, you can transform the weapon and a gravity barrier forms in front of you, granting you a +4 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> This glaive doesn't have the heavy property. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, as part of the attack, you can pierce the target, transform the weapon, and only pull out the spear. The shield remains in the target's body, impaling it. An impaled creature takes 2d4 slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and its speed is reduced to 0. To remove the shield, the impaled target can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check. Medium or smaller creatures have disadvantage on the check. On a success, the shield is removed and falls at the target’s feet. If you are within 5 feet of the shield, you can use a bonus action to retrieve and don it.</p>

            </div>
        <p>You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this magic weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the hookshot is two one-handed weapons connected by a short length of chain; a sickle and a blunderbuss. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single two-handed weapon; a blunderbuss with a bladed attachment that can act as a battleaxe.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> While untransformed, the sickle has the finesse property, and the blunderbuss doesn't have the two-handed property. Using this pair of weapons together requires the sickle to be held in one hand and the blunderbuss in the other. When you take the Attack action with the sickle, you can make an attack with the blunderbuss as a bonus action, ignoring the barrel property. If you hit a creature with the sickle and the blunderbuss on the same turn, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When you take the Attack action, you can attack with either the blunderbuss or the bladed attachment (which uses the stats of a battleaxe wielded with two hands). In addition, this item gains the Hookshot property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Hookshot.</i></b> As an action, you can launch the sickle from the blunderbuss, to which it remains attached by a length of sturdy chain. Make a ranged weapon attack against a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d4 plus your Dexterity modifier. If the creature is of your size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to you. If the creature is of a size larger than yours, you are pulled in a straight line to the nearest unoccupied space adjacent to it. At the end of your turn, you can detach the hook from the creature and reattach it to the blunderbuss; if you don't, the creature is grappled by you.</p>

The tarblood could not only be used to push past the apex of mortal power, but could also be used to create weapons—echoing the power of its wielder—when fused with moongold.</p>
        <p>This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness. In addition, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.</p>
        <p><b><i>Special Attunement.</i></b> While you are attuned to this weapon, you know one Blood Shot option of your choice from the Blood Archer Fighter (choose between Bloodboil, Constraining, Shadowblood, or Thunderblood Arrow). You can use this option when you make an attack with this bow. You can use this option twice, and you regain all expended uses daily at dawn. If you are a Blood Archer Fighter, you instead gain 2 additional uses of your Blood Shot feature.</p>
        <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the moongilded tarblood is a longbow. In its transformed state, it’s a longsword. By breaking the string, the tarblood melts and flows around the ivory handle, congealing into a longsword; if the sword handle is forcefully shoved into the blade, the weapon reverts into a longbow. Whenever you transform the weapon, the tarblood becomes unstable; your next hit with this weapon reduces the target’s speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn as the tar wraps around them, before retreating to the weapon.</p>
        <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The bow can fire regular ammunition, or it can fire lead bullets, the tarblood melting them into arrows.</p>
        <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> While this weapon is transformed, if you inflict 25 points of damage with it in a single turn against a creature that has blood, and you have no more than one use of your Blood Shot remaining, you regain one use of your Blood Shot.</p>

            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shortsword and &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos; from a shear, add both attacks to &apos;Attacks &amp; Spellcasting&apos;, then delete one of the &apos;Guillotine Shears&apos;.</p>

            <p>This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can magically melt the moongold before solidifying it, switching between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the equalizer is a flintlock. In its transformed state, the weapon is an ornate, two-handed weapon; a rifle.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> This flintlock has the Barrel 2 (F) property. In addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this flintlock.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When you attack with this weapon, you can choose to replace your attack with a particularly violent shot. Make a ranged weapon attack. On a hit, the target takes the weapon’s damage plus an extra 2d8 piercing damage. Hit or miss, this causes the weapon to partially liquefy and turn back into its untransformed state; it can’t be transformed again until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p>You can use this attack only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use this attack, your speed is 0 until the end of your turn.</p>

            <p>Infusing the bones of a beast with a mixture of quicksilver, mithral, and osteomantic magic, the Scions created a means of returning disabled hunters to the battlefield in full fighting form. Dark and metallic, the crevices of a phantom limb glow with a wan, cold light when fused with the warm body of its wielder.</p>
            <p><b><i>Attunement.</i></b> When you attune to this item, the cold, lifeless hand merges with your flesh and either replaces a missing arm or consumes one of your existing arms (your choice when you attune to this weapon). An arm consumed in this way does not reappear when you unattune from the item.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this magic weapon. In its untransformed state, the phantom limb is a metallic, articulating hand. In its transformed state, the weapon is a shortsword.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Unarmed strikes you make with the phantom limb deal magical bludgeoning damage. In addition, the limb reacts to deflect incoming blows, granting you a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this shortsword, which gains the Haunting Mark property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Haunting Mark.</i></b> Whenever you hit an undead creature with an attack using this blade then, for the next minute, you can see its form as a glowing outline, even if it is invisible, and you always know the direction and distance to the creature while it is on the same plane as you. This effect ends early if you hit a different undead creature with an attack using this blade, or if the phantom limb is no longer in its transformed state.</p>

            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gazer is a glaive. In its transformed state, the gazer is a glaive which can be used as a spellcasting focus.</p>
            <p>To transform this weapon, you must feed it your blood: each time you shift this weapon into its transformed state, or start your turn with the glaive in its transformed state, you take 1d4 necrotic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. This damage cannot break your concentration.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> While the glaive is in its transformed state, it grants you a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, increases your spell save DC by 1, and gives you truesight out to 30 feet.</p>

            <p>You have a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Attunement.</i></b> When you attune to this weapon, the cold, lifeless snake wraps around your forearm and bites your flesh, burying its head beneath it and inflicting 1d4 piercing damage. While attuned, you cannot be disarmed of this magical weapon. Ending the attunement causes the head to retract and the item to fall to the ground.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the bladewhip is a metallic whip. In its transformed state, the weapon solidifies by coagulating your blood to form a rapier.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Attacks you make with the serpent bladewhip add an additional 5 feet to your reach, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. In addition, if you hit a creature twice in a turn with this weapon, the whip’s devouring hunger awakens and tears out more of its flesh, dealing an extra 2d4 slashing damage.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> While transformed, you take 1 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns as the blade drains your blood to empower itself. This rapier gains the Fireblood Poison property and is considered silvered.</p>
            <p><b><i>Fireblood Poison.</i></b> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.</p>

        <description>
            <p>While attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning damage.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, if you've taken lightning damage or spent a hit die since the start of your last turn, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the claw is a sinewy leather gauntlet, made from the muscle and hide of a galvanized prowler. In its transformed state, the claw surges with electrical energy, merging with its wearer's forearm and turning into a monstrous claw.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The bestial hide feeds off of you in exchange for power; you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, this gauntlet devours your life force. When you hit with a melee attack, you can spend a hit die to deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</p>
            <p>The gauntlet has 2 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take lighting or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to instead take no damage and regain 1 hit die.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The gauntlet merges with your form, turning your hand into an aberrant claw that you cannot be disarmed of. This claw changes the damage of your unarmed strikes to 1d8, the damage type to slashing, and you can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with it. In addition, when you hit with a melee attack using this claw, you can spend a hit die to deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.</p>
            <p>The claw is too unwieldy to use for delicate handling, such as activating intricate mechanisms (like the trigger of a firearm) or picking locks with thieves' tools.</p>

            <p>While holding this weapon, your attacks and spells deal double damage to structures, and fire damage you take is reduced by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the crumbler is a roaring cannon with smoke coming out of its mouth. In its transformed state, the handle extends, turning the cannon into a highly unstable and destructive maul. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>When transforming the cannon into a maul, you can shoot at your feet, even if the cannon isn't loaded, using the deflagration to propel yourself and jump up to 30 feet in any direction. This jump doesn't cost you any movement.</li>
            <li>When transforming the maul into a cannon, you can reload the cannon and retain its unstable force. If you load it in this way, the next time you hit with an attack with the cannon attack on your turn, it will push you back 30 feet in a straight line.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The unstable crumbler heats up cannonballs, transforming them into infernal ammunition. Whenever you roll a 15 or higher on the d20 when making an attack roll with this weapon, the cannonball becomes overheated and explodes on impact. When the cannonball explodes in this way, it is considered an explosive cannonball.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> Whenever you roll a 18 or higher on the d20 while making an attack roll with this weapon, the maul's head detonates, causing an effect that acts as the <i>fireball</i> spell (DC 15) centered on the target. If you succeed on this saving throw, you take no damage.</p>

As part of this bonus action, you can slam the weapon down, emitting a wave of radiance centered on you. Each creature within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 radiant damage. Both forms of the weapon deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on a hit. This damage increases to 2d6 for the longsword against Medium or smaller aberrations and to 2d6 for the battleaxe against Large or larger aberrations.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> When you hit a creature with an attack using this longsword, you can cause another creature of your choice within 5 feet of it to take radiant damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 1).</p>

            <p>Battleaxe &amp; Pistol</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                    <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking 'Guillotine Shears' from a shortsword and 'Guillotine Shears' from a shear, add both attacks to 'Attacks &amp; Spellcasting', then delete one of the 'Guillotine Shears'.</p>
                </div>
            <p>The Caldera is an intimidating weapon. In its battleaxe form, it is crowned with a black-hole-like orb that bubbles menacingly with molten metal. This churning crucible holds the devastating axe together and serves as a searing ammunition barrel in the weapon's pistol form. When you attune to the Caldera, the metallic crucible at its apex ignites, constantly simmering with superheated lead. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. Each time you transform the weapon, you take 1d4 fire damage as the liquid-fire reservoir that serves as a material catalyst surges with thermal energy. In its untransformed state, the Caldera is a battleaxe that can devour its haft to reform into a pair of pistols, each holding half of the crucible. In its transformed state, the weapon is two pistols that can be slammed together to reform the crucible, alongside the rest of the battleaxe.</p>
            <p>When you transform this weapon into pistols, the crucible refills each of the barrels with 6 lead bullets (12 total), filling up one pistol fully, then the other. When you switch to the untransformed state of the weapon, any unfired lead bullets are re-added to the boiling metal.</p>
            <p>The boiling metal can contain up to 60 lead bullets, and the weapon can’t transform unless it contains at least 7 lead bullets. As an action, you can feed the crucible in either state by throwing lead bullets in it or by adding a cannonball, which counts as 30 bullets.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> When you hit with this battleaxe, you can expend 3 lead bullets from the boiling metal to cover the target in molten lead. The target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage, and it takes that damage again at the start of each of its turns unless it rolls on the floor (prone) or uses a bonus action to wipe off the lead.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> You pull out two fiery pistols from the molten metal. When you attack with them, you can use your Strength modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. These pistols are each loaded to full capacity, if there are enough lead bullets in the boiling metal.</p>
            <p>When you use the Fan Fire property of these pistols, the cumulative penalty per bullet fired is -2 instead of -3, and the pistol deals fire damage instead of piercing damage. In addition, if you roll a 1, the gun doesn’t jam, and you instead take 1d6 fire damage.</p>
            <p><b><i>Bullet Hell.</i></b> As an action, if both pistols are fully loaded, you can fire both of them in rapid succession, emptying all 12 bullets. Make 6 ranged attacks with the pistols, each dealing 1d6 piercing damage and 1d6 fire damage on a hit. Each attack after the first suffers a cumulative -2 penalty to the attack roll. You cannot add any modifier to the damage roll of these attacks beyond the first—such as the bonus from your Dexterity modifier or the Sharp-Shooter feat—apart from this weapon's bonus to damage rolls. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</p>

            <p>This sword, formed of coagulated blood, is a dark red, nearly black color. It is warm to the touch and emits a vigorous pulse. According to legend, the blade has a will of its own and grows stronger by consuming the blood of its victims. The sword may even make its master immortal, but at a heavy cost.</p>
            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a vile longsword glowing with echoes of blood. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword with an even more nefarious aspect.</p>
            <p>To transform this weapon, you must feed it blood. Each time you deal damage with this weapon to a creature that possesses blood, the épée gains 1 charge. The épée can hold up to 4 charges. Each charge lasts for 1 minute or until it is consumed. If this weapon has 1 or more charges, you can use your bonus action to transform it.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> You gain a 1d4 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that have more than half their hit points.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> You gain a 1d4 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are bloodied (half of its hit points or fewer). In this form, the épée sanguine consumes 1 charge at the end of each of your turns, unless you’ve expended 1 or more charges that turn. It reverts back to its untransformed state if it loses all charges.</p>
            <p>When you hit a creature with an attack using the épée, you can expend 1 or more charges to unleash the blood accumulated in the blade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1 Charge.</b> You heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</li>
                <li><b>2 Charges.</b> You deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage and heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</li>
                <li><b>3 Charges.</b> The target becomes bound in blood and must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t restrained.</li>
                <li><b>4 Charges.</b> Blood covers the creature’s face and chokes it. The creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.</li>

            <p>The splendor of the Radiant One is akin to the radiance of a thousand suns bursting in the sky all at once.</p>
            <p>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are proficient with greatswords and shortswords.</li>
                <li>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, the extra radiant damage increases to 2d4.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>The weapon's blade emits bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can summon or extinguish the light at will (no action required). This weapon has the Deflective Light property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Deflective Light.</i></b> When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property. This property can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic greatsword glowing with light. In its transformed state, the weapon is two shortswords emitting the same glow.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> While wielding this greatsword, your reflexes are enhanced. You gain a +1 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When you engage in two-weapon fighting with these shortswords, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, this weapon gains the Brightburn property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Brightburn.</i></b> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature two times with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy singes them. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

            <p>This weapon, crafted with moongold, gives you a 1d4 bonus to damage rolls against nonhumanoid creatures. Moongold acts as a guiding light in the darkness; creatures holding or wearing moongold have advantage on saving throws against being frightened and madness.</p>
            <p><b><i>Attunement.</i></b> This weapon has 5 charges and regains them daily at midnight. While attuned to this weapon, you can expend a charge to turn ephemeral, granting you the ability to walk through objects and creatures as if they were difficult terrain until the end of your turn. If you end your turn inside an object or creature, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can magically melt the moongold before solidifying it, switching between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the equalizer is a flintlock. In its transformed state, the weapon is an ornate, two-handed weapon; a rifle.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> This flintlock has the Barrel 2 (F) property. In addition, being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or targeting a prone creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with this flintlock.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When you attack with this weapon, you can choose to replace your attack with a particularly violent shot. Make a ranged weapon attack and expend up to 5 charges. On a hit, the target takes the weapon's damage plus an extra 2d8 piercing damage + an extra 1d8 radiant damage for each charge expended. If you expended more than 2 charges for the attack, the target is also blinded until the end of its next turn. Hit or miss, this causes the weapon to partially liquefy and turn back into its untransformed state; it can’t be transformed again until the end of your next turn. You can use this attack only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use this attack, your speed is 0 until the end of your turn.</p>

                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                    <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking 'Guillotine Shears' from a shortsword and 'Guillotine Shears' from a shear, add both attacks to 'Attacks &amp; Spellcasting', then delete one of the 'Guillotine Shears'.</p>
                </div>
            <div class="sidebar"> <p class="flavor">The Faux Lunaire is a weapon of mystery and celestial majesty, echoing the moon in its transformations. The creators of this weapon are the lunar wardens, who have to fight creatures that are far beyond mere beasts.</p> </div>
            <p>If you cast the <i>light</i> cantrip targeting this weapon, the carved runes activate. For the duration of the spell, as long as you hold the weapon, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, and you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> The Faux Lunaire is a wickedly curved scythe crafted from an arcane alloy and engraved with lunar imagery and celestial runes. With a swift, spinning motion, the limbs of the blade and shaft of the scythe fold in and rotate around the grip, locking into place to form an ornate longbow. As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. As part of this bonus action, you can also magically teleport up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. In its untransformed state, this weapon is a scythe. In its transformed state, it’s a longbow.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Once on each of your turns when you damage a creature with this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, becoming affected by the <i>faerie fire</i> spell on a failure. You do not need to concentrate on this spell, but it ends early if you put another creature under the effect of the spell, or if you fall unconscious.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> In its transformed state, the Faux Lunaire has 2 charges. When you attack a creature with this bow, you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17) from it (no action required): <i>moonbeam</i> or <i>darkness</i>. The spell is centered on the creature’s space and lasts until the end of your next turn. You do not need to concentrate on it, and you can only have one of these spells active at a time. If your attack misses, you expend the charge but the effect fails. The Faux Lunaire regains 1 expended charge each time it is targeted by the <i>light</i> cantrip.</p>

        <p>Unarmed Strike &amp; Claw</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                    <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking 'Guillotine Shears' from a shortsword and 'Guillotine Shears' from a shear, add both attacks to 'Attacks &amp; Spellcasting', then delete one of the 'Guillotine Shears'.</p>

            <p>Ripping the flesh of the beasts they slay to fashion ferocious weapons is something hunters have gotten remarkably good at over the course of their hunts.</p>
            <p>While attuned to this weapon, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the claw is a sinewy leather gauntlet, made from the muscle and hide of a galvanized prowler. In its transformed state, the claw surges with electrical energy, merging with its wearer’s forearm and turning into a monstrous claw.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The bestial hide invigorates you, giving you the lightning fast reflexes of the galvanized prowler slaughtered to make this gauntlet; you have advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, this gauntlet feeds off of your power. If you have temporary hit points when you hit with a melee attack, you deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage.</p>
            <p>The gauntlet has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. When you take lighting or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge to instead take no damage and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage you would have taken.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The gauntlet merges with your form, turning your hand into an aberrant claw that you cannot be disarmed of. This claw changes the damage of your unarmed strikes to 1d8, the damage type to slashing, and you can use your Dexterity or Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls made with it. Further, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you use the Attack action with this claw, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action. In addition, if you have temporary hit points, when you hit with a melee attack using this claw, you deal an extra 1d8 lightning damage.</p>
            <p>The claw is too unwieldy to use for delicate handling, such as activating intricate mechanisms (like the trigger of a firearm) or picking locks with thieves’ tools.</p>

                </div>
            <p>You have a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the guillotine is two one-handed weapons—a longsword and a shortsword. In its transformed state, the weapon is a single one-handed weapon—shears. As part of this bonus action, you can do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When transforming the swords into shears: you can make a single melee weapon attack with the shears. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative, and you can’t use the Guillotine property on this attack.</li>
                <li>When transforming the shears into swords: you can slide the longsword forward as part of dismounting it, making a single melee weapon attack with it. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative. If you have the Two-Weapon Fighting Style, you can ignore this limitation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> While wielding both swords, the longsword is considered light. The shortsword deals your choice of slashing or piercing damage. Whenever you damage a creature with both swords on the same turn, it takes extra slashing damage equal to your choice of either your Strength or Dexterity modifier (minimum of 1).</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The shears are a one-handed martial weapon that deals 1d12 slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit on a 19 or 20. In addition, it has the Guillotine property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Guillotine.</i></b> Immediately after hitting a target with the shears, if you have a free hand, you can use your reaction to pull the lever, snapping the blades together and dealing an extra 1d12 slashing damage to the target. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, you deal an extra 3d12 slashing damage. If this attack deals more than one quarter of a creature's hit point maximum, you also chop off one the creature's limbs (anything but the head) at the GM’s discretion. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is decapitated.</p>

            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the gazer is a glaive. In its transformed state, the gazer is a glaive which can be used as a spellcasting focus.</p>
            <p>To transform this weapon, you must feed it your blood: each time you shift this weapon into its transformed state, or start your turn with the glaive in its transformed state, you take 1d4 necrotic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. This damage cannot break your concentration.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> While the glaive is in its untransformed state, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making attack rolls using the glaive.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> While the glaive is in its transformed state, it grants you a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, increases your spell save DC by 1, and gives you truesight out to 30 feet.

            <p>Head and spine severed from a Cloistered Maiden, the first wielder of this accursed weapon was considered insane, even amongst madmen—after all, the difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits. To control the osteosymbiosis, one must fuse their arm to the bony corpse of an abomination of nature and pray that the gods won’t punish this crime against creation.</p>
            <p><b><i>Attunement.</i></b> When you attune to this item, the warm, still moving spine merges with the bones in your arm and replaces them. Bones consumed in this way do not reappear when you unattune from the item.</p>
            <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it has the Bone Explosion property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the osteosymbiosis is embedded in your flesh, with spikes protruding from your knuckles, changing your unarmed strikes.

            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Your unarmed attacks deal an extra 1d8 piercing damage. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an unarmed strike, you can rupture the bone spikes that grow from your hands, leaving them embedded in your prey. You deal an extra 1d4 piercing damage to your target and it gains 1 bone shard. Your bone protrusions regrow immediately.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> Your attacks with this weapon deal an extra 1d4 slashing damage and score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20. Further, the osseous nature of this armament renders it frail. If you score a critical hit against a creature, the weapon breaks upon the target's flesh, dealing an extra 4d4 piercing damage, and the target gains 4 bone shards. The weapon then reverts to its untransformed state.</p>
            <p><b><i>Bone Explosion.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can detonate all the bone shards embedded in one of your prey. If the target is dead, the shards fail to detonate. Each creature other than you within 15 feet of the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 1d4 piercing damage for each bone shard that detonated. On a success, it takes half as much damage. The bone shards shatter into dust and disappear. A creature with more than 2 bone shards embedded in its body has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
            <p><b><i>Maiden’s Curse:</i></b> While attuned to this weapon, when a Blood Moon of Rebirth rises, the maiden’s curse awakens and spreads to its owner. You must make a Wisdom saving throw against the Madness DC of the moon. If your character has a womb—or has ever had a womb in their body—on a failure, the weapon merges with you completely and you turn into a Cloistered Maiden under the GM’s control. If you never had a womb, on a failure, instead of transforming, you die.</p>

            <p><i>‘The Orphan's Tear is a flower that holds sway in Carmella’s heart. Engaging in a symbiotic rapport with the sanctified metal that surrounds it, the noxious bloom possesses near-flawless regenerative abilities. Moreover, the flowers exude a cloying fragrance, simultaneously repelling ravenous beasts and the cold touch of death. When set alight, the Orphan's Tear can serve as a very durable fuel, only to restore itself in a cycle of rebirth once the flames have been extinguished. Some say that this very capacity to elude the grasp of death is the force that set Carmella upon her unique destiny.’</i></p>
            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In both states, the weapon is a morningstar with the reach property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The flowers growing in the cradle exude a sickly sweet scent that calms the mind of men and chases away nightmares. Humanoids within 10 feet of the cradle have advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened condition. In addition, the cradle has the Vile Miasma and Cleansing Miasma properties.</p>
            <p><b><i>Vile Miasma.</i></b> When you hit a beast or an undead with orphan's cradle, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Vile Miasma for the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p><b><i>Cleansing Miasma.</i></b> As an action, you can cleanse one humanoid you can see within 10 feet of you. It gains 1d12 temporary hit points and can end one of the following conditions: charmed, frightened, or poisoned. Once a creature has benefited from this property, it can't benefit from it again for 1 hour.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When transformed, the cradle's plants ignite, and it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage on a hit. In addition, the weapon gains the Fanned Flames and Withering Flames properties.</p>
            <p><b><i>Fanned Flames.</i></b> As an action you can rotate the cradle wildly around you, fanning the flames. Each creature in a 20-foot cone in front of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Beasts and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. After using this property, orphan's cradle reverts to its untransformed state and can't be transformed again for 1d4-1 rounds.</p>
            <p><b><i>Withering Flames.</i></b> When you hit a beast or an undead with orphan's cradle, you can force the target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target becomes vulnerable to your choice of one of the following damage types until the start of its next turn: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or radiant. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cradle's Withering Flames for the next 24 hours.</p>

            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the executioner is a scythe and a lantern. In its transformed state, this weapon is a single massive maul.</p>
            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> When you hit a creature with the scythe, as part of the same attack, you can choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach to attack. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to your initial hit. If you do so, your speed is halved until the end of your turn. In addition, the executioner has the Harvest property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Harvest.</i></b> Whenever a creature of CR 1 or higher (or 1st level or higher) dies within 15 feet of you, the lantern harvests the creature’s soul. The soul becomes trapped in the lantern and the creature cannot be resurrected until the soul is freed. As an action, you can free a soul trapped in the lantern. The lantern can hold a maximum of three souls.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> The maul gains the Soul Explosion and Undying Light properties.</p>
            <p><b><i>Soul Explosion.</i></b> When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can sacrifice one of the souls held in the lantern to create a massive explosion of ghostflame, permanently destroying the soul. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 radiant damage and 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</p>
            <p><b><i>Undying Light.</i></b> If the lantern is holding at least one soul, the maul sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Each creature of your choice that enters the bright light for the first time on a turn or start its turn there must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on any attack roll that isn't against you until the start of its next turn. Undead automatically fail the saving throw.</p>

                </div>
            <p>Made of an unknown metal that mixes blood and steel, this ghastly sword is studded with dozens of eyes from various creatures that stare hungrily at all who are confronted with it. Only a competent hunter can wield a weapon of such weight, but armed with it, they will never lose sight of their prey and will never be caught in an ambush. Such a dangerous weapon should only be used with the utmost caution.</p>
            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to it, your sight improves as your vision starts echoing with that of the blade. While holding revelations, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can’t be surprised</li>
                <li>Other creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.</li>
                <li>You are immune to being blinded, as the sword absorbs the effect and closes two of its eyes instead, before regrowing them.</li>
        </ul>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the weapon is a cleaver studded with eyeballs. In its transformed state, the weapon is a whip composed of metal shards held together by a sinew of blood and flesh.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> When you hit a creature with this cleaver, you curse them for the next hour. For the duration, you gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with the weapon against the target, any attack roll you make with the weapon against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20, and you have advantage on any Perception or Survival check you make to find the target. The curse ends early if you transform the weapon or if you fall unconscious.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage on a hit, has the versatile (1d6/1d8) property, but does not have the finesse property. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can attempt to crush them under the weight of the whip. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or take 1d6 slashing damage and be knocked prone.</p>
            <p><b><i>Curse: Devour Sight.</i></b> While attuned to this weapon, your sight deteriorates rapidly. For each five days that pass, you gain a permanent -1 penalty to all Perception checks made using your sight. When this penalty reaches -5, your eyes rot and melt out, leaving you permanently blinded as two new eyes appear on the blade. The sword’s curse is insidious: while you remain attuned to the weapon, you do not suffer the penalty to your Perception checks, and you do not realize that your sight is worsening. The blade’s influence makes you perceive the world in a clearer light. Demidritches are immune to this curse.</p>

For each five days that pass, you gain a permanent -1 penalty to all Perception checks made using your sight.

                </div>
            <p>You have a +2 to attack and damage rolls made with both forms of this weapon.</p>
            <p><b><i>Attunement.</i></b> When you attune to this weapon, the cold, lifeless snake wraps around your forearm and bites your flesh, burying its head beneath it and inflicting 1d4 piercing damage. While attuned, you cannot be disarmed of this magical weapon. Ending the attunement causes the head to retract and the item to fall to the ground.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the bladewhip is a metallic whip. In its transformed state, the weapon solidifies by coagulating your blood to form a rapier.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> Attacks you make with the python bladewhip add an additional 5 feet to your reach, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it. In addition, if you hit a creature twice in a turn with this weapon, the whip's devouring hunger awakens and tears out more of its flesh, dealing an extra 4d4 slashing damage, and at the start of the target’s next turn, it takes an extra 2d4 slashing damage.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> While transformed, you take 1 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns as the blade drains your blood to empower itself. In addition, you gain immunity to the poisoned condition and to curses from spells (such as from <i>bestow curse</i>). This rapier gains the Fireblood Poison property and is considered silvered.</p>
            <p><b><i>Fireblood Poison.</i></b> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack using this blade, you can coat the wound with poison and the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is poisoned for the next minute as its innards start to boil. This can affect creatures immune to the poisoned condition. While poisoned in this way, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. This damage ignores resistance to fire damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the blade's Fireblood Poison for the next 24 hours.</p>

            <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 2d6 lightning damage on a hit. This weapon has the Explosive Retreat and Galvanic Engage properties.</p>
            <p><b><i>Explosive Retreat.</i></b> When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to detonate the creature. The creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The detonation pushes you 10 feet away from the creature. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Galvanic Engage.</i></b> On your first turn in combat, you can use your bonus action to move up to half your speed towards an enemy creature.

This weapon has the Guiding Fury and Lightning Surge properties.</p>
        <p><b><i>Guiding Fury.</i></b> While holding this weapon, you can unleash the rage held within its bones to make a ranged weapon attack with advantage. On a hit, you deal the weapon's damage and lightning streaks from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a ranged weapon attack against the new target, and on a hit, deal the weapon's damage and the lightning streaks again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of guiding fury.

        <p><b><i>Ionized Conduit.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can increase the polarity of the focus.

            <p><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> The <i>Shard of Moonlight</i> is a sentient weapon, with the same personality as the Great One whose flesh it was carved from. The weapon sporadically communicates telepathically with its wielder through images and sounds, though it doesn’t speak.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic longsword that absorbs light. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword that pulses with lunar energy. In both states, this weapon has the light property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> The blade seems to guide your strikes. Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with the shard, you can immediately make a second attack (no action required). It has the Void Absorption property</p>
            <p><b><i>Void Absorption.</i></b> The void that fills the blade is capable of absorbing magic. While holding the untransformed shard, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you. The absorbed spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the shard in the form of charges. The number of charges gained is equivalent to the level of the spell when it was cast (minimum of 1 for cantrips). The shard can absorb and store up to 10 charges. If the shard doesn’t have enough empty charges for a spell, it fails to absorb it. The blade regains all charges each time the moon changes.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> To transform this blade, you must use a bonus action while under direct moonlight. The transformation lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it early as a bonus action. When it transforms, you can expend the charges stored within the blade, and when the blade loses all charges, the transformation ends.</p>
            <p>While the blade is transformed, the extra radiant damage it deals on a hit increases from 1d6 to 2d6. Each time you make an attack in the transformed state, you can expend a number of charges to create special effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Revealing Glow.</b> As part of making an attack, you can expend 1 charge to empower the shard. On a hit, it deals an extra 1d12 radiant damage, and until the start of your next turn, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. While affected by the light, attack rolls against the target have advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected target can't turn invisible.</li>
                <li><b>Transient Moonlight.</b> As part of making an attack, you can expend 2 charges to release a wave of moonlight where the shard slashes, creating a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line of moonlight in front of you. A creature in the path of the moonlight must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d12 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
                <li><b>Lunar Explosion.</b> Instead of making an attack, you can expend 3 charges to raise the shard upward and release a burst of moonlight energy. Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 radiant damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone on a successful one. If a creature falls prone within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack against them with the shard.</li>

            <p>This weapon is the a Longsword.</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>Recomendation</h5>
                    <p>You can add both items to your inventory, add both attacks and then remove one of the items,  For example, taking 'Guillotine Shears' from a shortsword and 'Guillotine Shears' from a shear, add both attacks to 'Attacks &amp; Spellcasting', then delete one of the 'Guillotine Shears'.</p>
                </div>
            <p>The Sword of the Radiant Watcher is an ancient weapon, meant to contain two entities bound into eternal hatred. One was a hunter and one was a beast, though no one knows which aspect of the blade they were bound to.</p>
            <p><b><i>Sentience.</i></b> This sentient weapon has two distinct personalities, each linked to its corresponding transformed state. The Angelic personality (alignment: lawful good) is protective and nurturing, while the Hateful personality (alignment: chaotic evil) is cunning and ruthless. The weapon has an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 17. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The dominant personality may attempt to influence the wielder's actions, particularly when it comes to matters of morality or strategy. However, the sword cannot force its wielder to act against their will. The sword communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Deep Speech.</p>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon by letting hatred or hope overwhelm you. In both states, the weapon is a longsword. When the weapon's form changes, so too does its dominant personality. The two personalities within the Sword of the Radiant Watcher are in constant struggle for dominance. When the wielder attempts to switch the weapon’s forms, they must exert their force of will to do so, making a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the sword changes form, and on a failure, it stubbornly refuses to do so until the start of your next turn, at which point you can attempt to switch the weapon’s forms again.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed: Light Form.</i></b> The Angelic personality is dominant and the sword deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit.</p>
            <p><b><i>Curse of Light.</i></b> When you hit a creature with this sword, you can bind the target to your light (no action required). For the next minute, you are under the effect of the <i>sanctuary</i> spell, but only the bound target must make the saving throw. This effect ends as normal if you take an action that would break it but returns at the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Retribution of Light.</i></b> When a target is under the effect of the Curse of Light, as a bonus action, you can bolster up to four creatures of your choice that can hear you within 30 feet for the duration of the curse. While bolstered, they have advantage on their first attack roll against the target each turn, and if the attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to their proficiency bonus of the damage type they dealt. This property of the weapon can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed: Shadow Form.</i></b> The Hateful personality is dominant and the sword deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit.</p>
            <p><b><i>Shadow Chain.</i></b> When you hit a creature with this sword, you can tether the target to you with a chain of shadowy energy (no action required). While tethered, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and neither you nor the creature can willingly move or teleport more than 30 feet away from each other. The tether lasts for 1 minute, until you use this property on another creature, if you start your turn more than 30 feet away from the target, or end the tether as a bonus action.</p>
            <p><b><i>Shadow Consumption.</i></b> While tethered to a creature with your Shadow Chain, once on each of your turns when you hit the target with this weapon, you can inflict an extra 3d6 necrotic damage and gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. This property of the weapon can be used three times, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Aborrhant Existence.</i></b> The sentient entities within the sword are antithetical to each other, and no creature can withstand their presence at once, which is why the blade was sealed in such a way. Once on each of your turns, if both forms of the sword damage the same creature in a single turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or gain a short-term madness. In addition, if you deal necrotic damage with the shadow form of sword while the Curse of Light is in effect; or oppositely, if you deal radiant damage with the light form of the sword while the Shadow Chain is in effect, the effect ends and detonates. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 radiant damage and 2d6 necrotic damage as the antithetical energies resonate and self-destruct. You have advantage on this saving throw.</p>

                <div class="sidebar">

            <p>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage on a hit. When you hit a creature with blood with this weapon, the target takes an extra 1d8 necrotic damage.</li>
                <li>You are immune to poison and necrotic damage and the poisoned condition.</li>
                <li>You know the exact location of any creature with blood within a 30-foot radius, even if they are invisible or on the Ethereal plane.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The weapon has the Lifestealing property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Lifestealing.</i></b> In dire situations, the épée grants you the power to take the life of others. If you are reduced to one-quarter of your hit points or fewer, you can immediately use this property (no action required). Until the end of your next turn, whenever you deal damage using this weapon, you regain hit points equal to the damage dealt. Once this property of the weapon has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a vile longsword glowing with echoes of blood. In its transformed state, the weapon is a greatsword with an even more nefarious aspect.</p>
            <p>To transform this weapon, you must feed it blood. Each time you deal damage with this weapon to a creature that possesses blood, the épée gains 1 charge. The épée can hold up to 6 charges. Each charge lasts for 1 minute or until it is consumed. If this weapon has 1 or more charges, you can use your bonus action to transform it.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> You gain a 1d12 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are at their hit point maximum. In addition, the weapon has the Blood Shield property.</p>
                <p><b><i>Blood Shield.</i></b> The épée forms a barrier of blood around you with the blood it has absorbed. You gain a +1 bonus to AC for each 2 charges within the épée.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> You gain a 1d6 bonus to attack rolls you make with this weapon against creatures that are below their hit point maximum. In this form, the épée sanguine consumes 1 charge at the end of each of your turns, unless you’ve expended 1 or more charges that turn. It reverts back to its untransformed state if it loses all charges.</p>
            <p>When you hit a creature with an attack using the épée, you can expend 1 or more charges to unleash the blood accumulated in the blade:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1 Charge.</b> You heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</li>
                <li><b>2 Charges.</b> You deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and heal a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage you dealt.</li>
                <li><b>3 Charges.</b> The target becomes bound in blood and must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d6 necrotic damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t restrained.</li>
                <li><b>4 Charges.</b> Blood covers the creature’s face and chokes it. The creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.</li>

            <p>The method to create the Épée Solaire is a tight-lipped secret, involving harnessing the power of the sun, a method that only devout followers of the Radiant One can grasp. As time went on, the sun faded from the skies of Luyarnha, replaced by a never ending night, and so, the creation of this weapon became impossible. This Épée Solaire was bathed in the blood of the sun, unleashing its potential.</p>
            <p>While attuned to this weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are proficient with greatswords and shortswords.</li>
                <li>You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. When you hit an aberration or undead with it, the extra radiant damage increases to 2d8.</li>
                <li>You have advantage on saving throws against madness.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>The weapon's blade emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. You can summon or extinguish the light at will (no action required). Each creature of your choice in the light has resistance to radiant damage. This weapon has the Deflective Light property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Deflective Light.</i></b> When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to cause a burst of sunlight to flare before the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll and transforming the weapon. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Trick Weapon.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can switch between the transformed and untransformed states of this weapon. In its untransformed state, the blade is a metallic greatsword glowing with light. In its transformed state, the weapon is two shortswords emitting the same glow.</p>
            <p><b><i>Untransformed.</i></b> While wielding this greatsword, your senses are pushed to their limit. You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. In addition, the weapon has the Light of Judgment property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Light of Judgment.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can unleash judgment upon the heretics. The blade’s light is summoned for the next minute or until you fall unconscious or transform the weapon. You and all hostile creatures within the bright light immediately take 2d8 radiant damage. In addition, for the duration, you deal an extra 2d8 radiant damage whenever you damage a creature with the épée, and radiant damage you deal ignores resistance to radiant damage.</p>
            <p><b><i>Transformed.</i></b> When you engage in two-weapon fighting with these shortswords, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. In addition, this weapon gains the Sunscorch property.</p>
            <p><b><i>Sunscorch.</i></b> Whenever you hit a creature two times in a turn with these shortswords, the accumulated solar energy detonates. Each creature in a 15-foot radius must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
