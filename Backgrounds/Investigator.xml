Regardless of the specifics, you are a seeker of knowledge and truth, using your keen insight and intellect to unravel the mysteries that plague your world. You might be a former scholar, a detective, or just an average citizen who was personally affected by these events, and you won't stop until you reveal the truth.</p>

You have an uncanny knack for seeing through lies and half-truths, and people tend to reveal more information to you, either intentionally or not. You have a knack for getting people to open up to you, whether it's through kindness, intimidation, or trickery.</p>
