		<description>
			<p>Whether through your own choice or a twist of fate, you found yourself part of a clandestine and often misunderstood group of individualsâ€”a cult. This may have been a circle focused on the symbiotic relationship of flesh and nature, a scholastic order obsessed with the cosmos, or followers of a prophecy predicting the apocalypse. However, your faith or circumstances have since changed, leading you to leave the confines of the cult. You might still be an active member, or you've escaped its influence. Either way, your experiences within the cult and the knowledge you've gained have left a deep impact on your life.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Skill Proficiencies:</b> Choose one between Arcana or Religion; and one between Persuasion or Survival</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Languages:</b> Choose one between Deep Speech, Infernal and Sylvan, reflecting the cult to which you belonged</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> One type of artisan's tools or musical instrument</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Equipment:</b> A set of common clothes, a brimmed cloak, a trinket or symbol representing your cult, a piece of jewelry worth 10 gp, a hooded lantern, five flasks of oil, and a pouch containing 5 gp.</p>
			<div element="ID_LT_SGEH_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_CULT_SECRETS" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Whether you are a current or former member of a cult, your experiences have shaped you. As a follower, you are guided by deep-seated beliefs and rituals, while as a former member, your past continues to haunt you, and you may be driven by a desire for redemption or revenge.</p>
