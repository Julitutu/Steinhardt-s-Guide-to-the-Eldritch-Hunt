		<description>
			<p>You are a member of the Scions, a group of brilliant, boundary-pushing scientists, working at the fringe of societal norms and scientific understanding. You have seen life being breathed into the lifeless, creating living constructs through electrifying science, a practice never seen before. As a member of the Scions, the inventions and creations of your group have earned favor among the city's higher-ups, and given delusions of grandeur to those of you who wrestle with the godlike power of creation at your fingertips.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Skill Proficiencies:</b> Arcana, Investigation</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Tool Proficiencies:</b> Tinker's tools, one type of artisan's tools of your choice</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Languages:</b> One of your choice</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Equipment:</b> A set of tinker's tools, a set of artisan's tools, a notebook full of your scientific sketches and notes, a bottle of black ink, a quill, a small experimental creation of your design, and a pouch containing 15 gp</p>
			<div element="ID_LT_SGEH_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_SCIONS_CREATION" />
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>As a Scion, you have been at the forefront of scientific exploration and innovation. The thrill of discovery and the power to create or reanimate life fill you with excitement or perhaps existential dread. The impact of your inventions on society and the moral implications of your work are things you grapple with.</p>

		<supports>Background Feature</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Your time as a Scion has made you an expert in the creation and maintenance of complex machinery and constructs. You can spend an hour to perform maintenance on a construct, restoring a number of hit points to it equal to your level; a creature can only benefit from this feature once per day. Additionally, you can identify, inspect, and assess the function and value of mechanical or arcane devices or constructs. This does not mean you know how to operate such a device if you have never handled it before.</p>
