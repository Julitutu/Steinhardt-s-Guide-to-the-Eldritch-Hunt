            <p>
                The city of Luyarnha has never experienced the threat
                of devils, as if fiends fear coming near the city walls.
                This absence extends to those of infernal descent;
                tieflings born in the gothic city are severed from their
                devilish origins, their blood becoming tied to something
                far more sinister.
            </p>
            <p>
                Called “accursed” due to their monstrous appearance,
                they are feared by most, and their powers envied by
                nearly as many, letting their jealousy morph into hatred;
                an accursed existence indeed. These tieflings possess a
                fraction of the power of their dark mother’s boundless
                reproduction and are incapable of creating life, though
                they can create figments of it, with the most powerful
                capable of creating ephemeral copies of themselves to
                fight in battle. These tieflings never stay in the city for
                long, vanishing shortly after reaching adulthood.
            </p>
            <h4>Accursed Tiefling Features</h4><br />
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Appearance.</i></b>
                Accursed tieflings vastly differ from their
                brethren. Instead of a pair of horns, they have dozens
                protruding from their skull, akin to a never-ending
                cancerous growth. Their monstrous shape is furthered
                by the eye-like protrusions that cover the horns,
                although they are nothing more than bony sprouts
                waiting to burgeon. Their skin is thick, covered in
                bestial fur, and their muscular limbs are grossly
                misshaped; the human half of their heritage has nearly
                all but vanished.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>
                Your Constitution score increases by 1.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Languages.</i></b>
                You can speak, read, and write Common
                and Deep Speech.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Child of the Black Goat.</i></b>
                You have a climbing speed
                equal to your walking speed.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Eldritch Resistance.</i></b>
                You have resistance to necrotic
                damage.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Legacy of a Thousand Young.</i></b>
                You know the spare the
                dying cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast
                the false life spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this
                trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the mirror
                image spell once with this trait. You regain the ability to
                cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long
                rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these
                spells
            </p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Call of the Brood.</i></b>
                If a Blood Moon is out while you are
                asleep, you have a dream (as per the spell, save DC 16).
                In this dream, the Black Goat places a
                compulsion within your mind, ordering
                you to carry out some activity as a
                torrent of images and sensations.
                When you awaken, you are
                automatically affected
                by a suggestion spell
                (save DC 16, cast as a
                7th-level spell) in
                addition to the
                effects of
                dream, and
                must carry
                out the
                order.
